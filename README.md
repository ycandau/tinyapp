## About

TinyApp is a full stack web application built with Node and Express that allows users to shorten long URLs (Ã  la bit.ly).

---

## Features

The application allows users to create and store shortened URLs in their account. It implements a range of security features (no [plain text offender here](https://plaintextoffenders.com/)):

- password hashing
- cookie encryption

**Method overriding** is used to implement a REST API for PUT and DELETE methods.

**Analytics** are available per URL to track:

- the date of creation
- the total number of visits
- the number of unique visits (based on visitor cookies)
- a full log of every visit

## Error management

| Status code | Type               | Cause                                     |
| ----------- | ------------------ | ----------------------------------------- |
| 400         | Bad request        | Email or password is empty                |
| 400         | Bad request        | Email is already registered               |
| 401         | Unauthorized       | Email is not registered                   |
| 401         | Unauthorized       | Incorrect password                        |
| 401         | Unauthorized       | User is not logged in                     |
| 403         | Forbidden          | User does not own short URL               |
| 404         | Not found          | Short URL does not exist                  |
| 405         | Method not allowed | Method overridden: Use `PUT /urls/:id`    |
| 405         | Method not allowed | Method overridden: Use `DELETE /urls/:id` |

The last two error messages are in response to incorrect methods, as `POST` methods are overridden to implement a REST API:

- To edit an URL use `PUT /urls/:id` instead of `POST /urls/:id`
- To delete an URL use `DELETE /urls/:id` instead of `POST /urls/:id/delete`

---

## Known issues

Due to the behaviour requirements for the project, logging out leads to an error message:

- On logout the user cookie is deleted.
- The user is then redirected to `/urls`.
- This triggers an error message for a logged out user at `urls`.

The route is left as is to follow the behaviour requirements.
